| December 2nd | 9:25 - 10:16  | I started with my idea of using the most common words in the english language in a dictionary. When one of the common words is found, it will print an escape char (255), and then write the corresponding index in the array of the word. I will then continue in this code writing mode until a non-common word is found, where I will again print the escape char, but this time it indicates to switch back to normal char reading mode. I have a first version of this code, and it gets most of the words correctly but I am having an issue where there are tons of extra the and ands being printing, I think this is a bit alignment thing maybe because these correspond to 0 and 1 in my common words array. I'll try to debug this. |

This fixed some of the issues but there are still extra things being printed and I can't figure out why. |

I can't answer this question. :( |

I replaced 'all' with ' ' in the most common words list and it works now. This is not the optimal solution but at least it works. The compression ratio is horrible though, like 98% so it barely helps, least it doesn't make it bigger. |
