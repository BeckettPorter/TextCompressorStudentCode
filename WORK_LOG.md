| December 2nd | 9:25 - 10:16  | I started with my idea of using the most common words in the english language in a dictionary. When one of the common words is found, it will print an escape char (255), and then write the corresponding index in the array of the word. I will then continue in this code writing mode until a non-common word is found, where I will again print the escape char, but this time it indicates to switch back to normal char reading mode. I have a first version of this code, and it gets most of the words correctly but I am having an issue where there are tons of extra the and ands being printing, I think this is a bit alignment thing maybe because these correspond to 0 and 1 in my common words array. I'll try to debug this. |

This fixed some of the issues but there are still extra things being printed and I can't figure out why. |

I can't answer this question. :( |

I replaced 'all' with ' ' in the most common words list and it works now. This is not the optimal solution but at least it works. The compression ratio is horrible though, like 98% so it barely helps, least it doesn't make it bigger. |

I also made a new branch so hopefully that will not mess up my github submission. |

I made a helper method that is supposed to get the code/add the next one but it doesn't work correctly and I am still a bit confused about the algorithm in general. I'll ask for some help in class and hopefully be able to figure it out then. Update: I got it to successfully do the compression without any errors now, not sure if it works yet though because I have no way to test it. |

I'm having issues with both the compression and expansion, mostly just index out of bounds errors that I somehow need to figure out how to prevent. I also am not sure if I need to use a RADIX for something because I don't know where I would be using that but people are talking about using that in class? I need to do a lot more debugging and also probably just understand the algorithm better because I think I am still confused about parts of it. |
