| December 2nd  | 9:25 - 10:16  | I started with my idea of using the most common words in the english language in a dictionary. When one of the common words is found, it will print an escape char (255), and then write the corresponding index in the array of the word. I will then continue in this code writing mode until a non-common word is found, where I will again print the escape char, but this time it indicates to switch back to normal char reading mode. I have a first version of this code, and it gets most of the words correctly but I am having an issue where there are tons of extra the and ands being printing, I think this is a bit alignment thing maybe because these correspond to 0 and 1 in my common words array. I'll try to debug this. |

This fixed some of the issues but there are still extra things being printed and I can't figure out why. |

I can't answer this question. :( |

I replaced 'all' with ' ' in the most common words list and it works now. This is not the optimal solution but at least it works. The compression ratio is horrible though, like 98% so it barely helps, least it doesn't make it bigger. |

I also made a new branch so hopefully that will not mess up my github submission. |

I made a helper method that is supposed to get the code/add the next one but it doesn't work correctly and I am still a bit confused about the algorithm in general. I'll ask for some help in class and hopefully be able to figure it out then. Update: I got it to successfully do the compression without any errors now, not sure if it works yet though because I have no way to test it. |

I'm having issues with both the compression and expansion, mostly just index out of bounds errors that I somehow need to figure out how to prevent. I also am not sure if I need to use a RADIX for something because I don't know where I would be using that but people are talking about using that in class? I need to do a lot more debugging and also probably just understand the algorithm better because I think I am still confused about parts of it. |
| December 10th |  8:30 - 9:03  |                                                    I'm trying to debug this code, I finally got it to mostly run without an error, but i'm having an issue with the exit code. For some reason my while loop is going out of bounds, this doesn't make sense though because it should stop when I reach the exit code which I print out at the very end of the compress method. I don't get how it doesn't see this exit code and stop the while loop, maybe it is something with how I read the entire thing into a string?? I have no clue and this is honestly very confusing, also my outputted unCompressed text file is absolutely broken so the expand method definitely is not working correctly (or maybe the compression is wrong ?). |

I also learned the way to easily get the number 2^n using bit shifting to calculate the max number of codes. I got it working for alice, but for abra I am getting an index out of bounds error still for some reason. |
